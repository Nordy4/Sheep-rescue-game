# Sheep-rescue-game
I've added hearts to appear when hitting a sheep as well as sound effects for different actions. I have also added background sound to the game.
Despite following the tutorial, the hay does not collide properly with the hay destroyer and sometimes the interaction of colliding hay and sheep takes a little to occur.
